                    <p class="hashira-description">A mystic known for her visions and her harrowing, constant encounters with the Devil, who attempted to trick, wound, and terrorize her physically and spiritually. She endured these attacks for the salvation of souls.</p>

                    <p class="hashira-description">A foundational figure in monasticism. He retreated to the desert where he was repeatedly and severely tempted and beaten by demons appearing as wild beasts, to deter him from his life of prayer.</p>

                    <p class="hashira-description">While living as a hermit, demons, often disguised as tempting figures, tried to break his resolve. Later, as an Abbot, he wielded divine power to break a glass of poisoned wine and shattered a contaminated loaf of bread, all set by envious monks possessed by a murderous demon, using only the Sign of the Cross. His power establishes order and casts out all impure spirits.</p>

                    <p class="hashira-description">This Mystic experienced frequent, terrifying encounters, noting that demons were often 'grotesque' and 'fire-breathing.' She wasn't just attacked; she fought back with sharp words and holy water, famously laughing at the Demon when it fled. She defeated the demonic onslaught by simply focusing her mind on the true presence of the Divine within her 'Interior Castle,' shattering their illusions.</p>

                    <p class="hashira-virtue"><strong>Guiding Virtue:</strong> Integrity & Eloquence</p>
                    <p class="hashira-description">Known as the 'Golden-Mouthed' for his powerful preaching. His strength was in exposing hypocrisy, which demons used to incite his human enemies (corrupt government and church officials) against him. Even while in brutal exile, he was hounded by constant demonic threats and illness designed to silence his truthful voice. He died whispering his final victory cry: "Glory be to God for all things!"</p>

                    <p class="hashira-virtue"><strong>Guiding Virtue:</strong> Joy & Simplicity</p>
                    <p class="hashira-description">Francis literally fought against temptations of the flesh sent by demons. Once, to defeat a demonic temptation of a beautiful woman, he famously stripped naked and rolled in a patch of thorns and snow to subdue the flesh, driving the demon away in terror. He saw the Devil as the manifestation of *attachment to earthly wealth*, and his weapon was his joyous, radical poverty, which demons could not comprehend.</p>

                    <p class="hashira-virtue"><strong>Guiding Virtue:</strong> Silence & Humility</p>
                    <p class="hashira-description">Arsenius wrestled with a recurring demonic command that shouted, "Flee from men, and you will be saved!" His true battle was the internal warfare to achieve perfect quietness (hesychia). He was often attacked in his cell by demons trying to lure him back to the world's power or discourage his prayers, but he defeated them by staying put, weeping for his sins, and never speaking a word outside of necessity.</p>

                    <p class="hashira-virtue"><strong>Guiding Virtue:</strong> Patience & Hardship</p>
                    <p class="hashira-description">Macarius's endurance was legendary, making him a primary target. Once, a demon attacked him by physically **striking him with a sharp sickle**, leaving a visible wound, which Macarius bore without complaint. In another instance, the Devil appeared as a gigantic, intimidating monster, but Macarius ignored it, crushing the demon's pride. He repeatedly outsmarted and survived physical assaults by using extreme penance, like sleeping in a swamp to defeat the demon of *impatience*.</p>

                    <p class="hashira-virtue"><strong>Guiding Virtue:</strong> Steadfastness & Sacrifice</p>
                    <p class="hashira-description">Simeon's battle was a vertical demonstration of will. One of the most famous attacks involved a demon appearing as a **shining chariot** with heavenly horses, claiming to be sent by God to take Simeon to heaven. Simeon, recognizing the spirit of *Pride*, refused, forcing the magnificent apparition to vanish in a cloud of smoke. His defense was his pillar itself—a symbol of refusal to touch the corrupting earth.</p>

                    <p class="hashira-description">As a former Imperial officer, Martin brought military discipline to his spiritual warfare. He would often **stand on the ruins of destroyed pagan altars**, provoking the presiding demon to appear and try to drive him off with threats, fire, and monstrous shapes. In one famous confrontation, the Demon appeared to him dressed in royal purple, wearing a diadem, and claiming to be Christ, only to be quickly debunked and driven away by Martin's immediate command to confess his identity.</p>
