       <h3>Morning Prayer</h3>
         <p>Begin your day with a moment of reflection and gratitude. As you inhale deeply, visualize the light of the sun filling your lungs, energizing your body and spirit. As you exhale, release any negativity or doubts that may hinder your path. Repeat this process three times, focusing on the warmth and strength that the morning light brings.</p>

         <h4>The Angelus</h4>
        <p> V/. The Angel of the Lord declared unto Mary,
R/. And she conceived of the Holy Spirit.

Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you;
blessed are you among women,
and blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners
now and at the hour of our death.
Amen.

V/. Behold the handmaid of the Lord,
R/. Be it done unto me according to your Word.
Hail Mary…

V/. And the Word was made flesh,
R/. And dwelt among us.
Hail Mary…

V/. Pray for us, O holy Mother of God,
R/. That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.

Let us pray. Pour forth, we beseech you, O Lord, your grace into our hearts: that we, to whom the Incarnation of Christ your Son was made known by the message of an Angel, may by his Passion and Cross be brought to the glory of his Resurrection. Through the same Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>

<h3>Midday</h3>
            <p>Take a break from your daily activities to center yourself. Find a quiet place to sit comfortably. Close your eyes and take a deep breath in, imagining a radiant light entering your body, filling you with peace and clarity. As you exhale, let go of any stress or distractions. Repeat this breathing exercise five times, allowing yourself to reconnect with your inner strength and purpose.</p>
            <h4>The Serenity Prayer</h4>
            <p>God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
Courage to change the things I can, 
And wisdom to know the difference.</p>
    </main>

    <h3>Evening</h3>
            <p>As the day comes to a close, take a moment to reflect on your experiences. Sit or lie down in a comfortable position. Inhale deeply, envisioning a calming light surrounding you, bringing tranquility to your mind and body. As you exhale, release any lingering tension or worries from the day. Repeat this process five times, allowing yourself to unwind and prepare for restful sleep.</p>
            <h4>Act Of Contrition</h4>
            <p>O my God,
I am heartily sorry for having offended you,
and I detest all my sins because of your just punishments,
but most of all because they offend you, my God,
who are all good and deserving of all my love.
I firmly resolve, with the help of your grace,
to sin no more
and to avoid the near occasions of sin.
Amen.</p>
